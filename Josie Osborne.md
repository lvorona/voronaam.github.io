Josie Osborne is a marine biologist currently serving her third term as mayor of Tofino. Osborne has lived in Tofino for over 20 years, first moving to the area to work as a fisheries biologist for the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council. She has served as Chair of the Board for the Island Coastal Economic Trust and in numerous leadership roles including Chair of Tourism Tofino, and Executive Director of both the Tofino Botanical Gardens Foundation and the Raincoast Education Society.

Osborne is following the political footsteps of current Mid Island-Pacific Rim NDP MLA and former Tofino Mayor, Scott Fraser - who is not seeking reelection. Having run unopposed in her first two stints as mayor, she won her last election with 86% of the vote. As mayor, Josie Osborne has focused on infrastructure, affordable housing and strategic procurement in an effort to ensure local tax dollars are spent in the community.
