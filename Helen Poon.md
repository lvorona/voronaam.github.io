Helen Poon is an attorney, entrepreneur and classic car collector who has served as a Port Alberni City Councillor since 2018. She relocated to Port Alberni in 2017 where she purchased a hotel and pub and transformed the business into a popular community entertainment hub. Poon’s vision as an entrepreneur has translated into her work as a City Councillor who seeks to transform the Port Alberni economy by making it a tourism destination with a good mix of heavy and light industries, services, and retail economies.

Before her work in Port Alberni, Helen Poon worked in real estate management with an emphasis on providing affordable housing for low income seniors and the mentally ill. In Port Alberni she has worked as a board member of the Literacy Alberni Society and the Young Professionals of the Alberni Valley. Her peers on the Port Alberni City Council chose her to serve as Director-at-Large on the board of the Union of B.C. Municipalities, which her campaign describes as an “opportunity to further understand and advocate for municipal issues throughout the province.”
